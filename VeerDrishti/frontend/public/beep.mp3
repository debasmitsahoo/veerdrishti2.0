# Placeholder for beep.mp3
# This file should contain a short beep sound (1-2 seconds) for alert notifications
# You can replace this with an actual audio file or generate one using:
# - Online tone generators
# - Text-to-speech with "beep" 
# - Any short alert sound file

# For demo purposes, the application will work without this file
# but users won't hear audio alerts for HIGH severity notifications
